Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

This fork is a very small modification to the launcher that allows for offline accounts to be used without an existing premium account added to the launcher.

Some of the reasons this was made:

* Microsoft's decisions over Minecraft's account system which now forces players to create a Microsoft account to continue playing and most likely have their information collected then sold.
* Mojang's account moderation / deletion for wrongthink.
* Mojang's recent addition of Snooper to 1.18, an analytics reporter that Mojang promises to not misuse but probably will.

Please keep in mind that I do not support piracy because piracy is illegal and not allowed on GitHub. I just made this for those who own a premium account but do not want to authenticate with Microsoft servers to play the game.

Also know that because you are using an offline account, no server can be joined unless it is modified by the server owner to skip player verification. The most popular servers are not going to be playable.

This is a **FORK** and not endorsed by MultiMC, PolyMC, or PrismLauncher teams. Please check the upstream repo for additional details and thanks.
